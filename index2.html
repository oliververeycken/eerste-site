			<h2>Pizza, pasta, arte!</h2>
				<h4>Gepost op 3 mei 2016</h4>
				<p>
					Just had an amazing dinner in the ultimate Italian restaurant of Antwerp.
					Homemade pizza, pasta, exquisite wine, great people,... what more can one ask for?
					I've been going here for my whole life and not once have I been dissappointed.
					Excellent service, utterly friendly, incredibble menu and all of that for an extremely reasonable price.
					Art is spread throughout the restaurant and are hidden in the tiniest of corners.
				</p>
				<p>
					Pizza Arte has been a reference for Italian food for as long as I have known.
					All kinds of people, from business to family dinners,
					from lovers to first dates,...
					come here to enjoy this lovely spot in the city centre of Antwerp.
				</p>
				<p>
					They recently remodelled which led to a more spacious bathroom (which, according to me, was absolutely necessary!).
